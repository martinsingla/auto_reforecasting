# Automatic Updating/ Re-Forecasting Macro Variables Functions

While modeling and forecasting commercial vehicle (CV) sales in the Mexican market, we found out a strong correlation with some key macroeconomic indicators along history. To use those macro variables as assumptions for CV sales forecasts, we had to forecast macro variables too. We used INEGI's historic series for GDP estimate, which are directly served through an open API, and updated every quarter. [(INEGI API webpage)](https://www.inegi.org.mx/servicios/api_indicadores.html). The macroeconomic indicators are modeled and forecasted using SARIMA models or Facebook Prophet additive model [(Prophet Library)](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/). However, to match our naive forecasts with industry experts' expectations on macroeconomic near future, we used BANXICO's [Macroeconomic Expectations' Survey] (https://www.banxico.org.mx/publicaciones-y-prensa/encuestas-sobre-las-expectativas-de-los-especialis/encuestas-expectativas-del-se.html) , which is updated every month. The survey reports annual GDP growth expectations for the next 3 years and average for the next decade, and the data is served through an open API too. The modeled quarterly forecasts are re-adjusted to match Banxico's annual data. Finally, forecasted macroeconomic indicators are used as exogenour regressors for our CV sales forecast models. The great advantage of these auto-forecasting functions based on open API served data is that we can now uodate our CV sales forecasts almost automatically every month , with full knowledge of the changing assumptions, followung the "Human in the Loop" concept of AI solutions for business analytics.
